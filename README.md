# Simple research paper saver

## About

A simple extension to save and organize your research papers (cause I'm sick of keeping track of it in docs and sheets).

## How To Use
1. Navigate to the releases to download the zip file or simple clone this repo.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/research-paper-extension
```
2. Go to the extensions tab in Edge or Chrome. I mainly developed this using MS Edge `edge://extensions/`.
3. Enable developer support (a formal release will be made soon to the extension stores).
4. Select the directory of this project/the unpacked directory if you're downloading a .zip file.
5. Open the extension. If you don't see it click on the puzzle icon on the top right. ![](./tutorial_imgs/image.png)
6. When you load it at first, you will need to create a new group before you can add papers (if you want a general paper dump, name the first group anything you like). ![](./tutorial_imgs/image2.png)
7. Once you create a group, navigate to the **Save to Group** card above, and click on the group you want to save the paper to. ![](./tutorial_imgs/image3.png)
8. Click on the Save Paper button ![](./tutorial_imgs/image4.png)
9. Scroll down to see your saved papers. The default view shows all your papers (regardless of groups) \\ ![](./tutorial_imgs/image5.png)
10. If you want to see your papers in groups, click on the dropout on the top-right of the card, and click on the group you want to filter \\ ![](./tutorial_imgs/image6.png)
11. You can now see your papers filtered by groups \\ ![](./tutorial_imgs/image7.png)

## Future releases
1. Add export to sheet or doc option later
2. Add option to download the saved groups to local/drive
3. Add option for users to color their groups
4. idk what else will think of stuff later...

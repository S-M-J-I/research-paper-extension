# Simple research paper saver

## About

A simple extension to save and organize your research papers (cause I'm sick of keeping track of it in docs and sheets).

## How To Use
1. Navigate to the releases to download the zip file or simple clone this repo.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/research-paper-extension
```
2. Go to the extensions tab in Edge or Chrome. I mainly developed this using MS Edge `edge://extensions/`.
3. Enable developer support (a formal release will be made soon to the extension stores).
4. Select the directory of this project/the unpacked directory if you're downloading a .zip file.
5. Enjoy!

## Future releases
1. Add export to sheet or doc option later
2. Add option to download the saved groups to local/drive
3. Add option for users to color their groups
4. idk what else will think of stuff later...
